## How this will help you/ why this is useful
This chapter sets out the definition of reproducibility that the Turing Way project team used when writing this handbook. 
It will be useful to avoid misunderstandings when reading the rest of the handbook.

### Why reproducibility is important for science

Major media outlets have picked up on investigations that show that a significant percentage of scientific studies cannot be reproduced. (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/attempt-to-replicate-major-social-scientific-findings-of-past-decade-fails) 
This leads to other academics and society loosing trust in scientific results. (Baker, 2016).
Working reproducibly means others can check your results - even early on in the research process. 
Thus, valuable time is saved as reproducing results is quick and research outputs can be re-used for other analyses.
In addition, so called "negative results" can be published easily and avoid that other researchers waste time repeating analyses that will not return the expected results. (Dirnagl & Lauritzen, 2010)

### Why you should care about reproducibility

Markowetz highlights five reasons to work reprodubily (Markowetz, 2015):
- Avoiding desaster: Through working reproducibly, you can trust your own research results and will not have to retract published results or keep publications back because you cannot reproduce your results.
- Writing papers easier: well documented analyses ensure you have easy access to the latest results and your work can easily be written up and collaborators can easily get on board as additional authors. 
Furthermore, you can be sure that you easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.
- Convincing reviewers: Making code and data available to the reviewers means their review comments will be constructive as they are able to develop an in-depth understanding of your work and can even try changes to your analysis themselves and see the impact.
- Facilitating continuity of work: Well documented work means others your work can easily be picked up and continued - either by other in your lab or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period.
- Building your reputation: Putting in effort to make your research reproducible shows that you are a careful researcher and makes your research results more robust. 

Papers whose underlying data is available get cited more often (Piwowar, Day & Fridsma, 2007, Piwowar & Vision, 2013). 
All research outputs that are shared can be built upon by others and in some cases, others following up on your work might lead to new collaborations. 
Other benefits of working openly are covered in our Open Science chapter. 


### Definitions of reproducibility

Victoria Stodden [(2014)](http://edge.org/response-detail/25340), a prominent scholar on this topic, has identified some useful distinctions in reproducible research:

- _Computational reproducibility_: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.

- _Empirical reproducibility_: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practise this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.

- _Statistical reproducibility_: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations. 

[Stodden et al. (2013)](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf) place **computational reproducibility** on a spectrum with five categories that account for many typical research contexts:

- _Reviewable Research_. The descriptions of the research methods can be independently assessed and the results judged credible. (This includes both traditional peer review and community review, and does not necessarily imply reproducibility.)
- _Replicable Research_. Tools are made available that would allow one to duplicate the results of the research, for example by running the authors’ code to produce the plots shown in the publication. (Here tools might be limited in scope, e.g., only essential data or executables, and might only be made available to referees or only upon request.)
- _Confirmable Research_. The main conclusions of the research can be attained independently without the use of software provided by the author. (But using the complete description of algorithms and methodology provided in the publication and any supplementary materials.)
- _Auditable Research_. Sufficient records (including data and software) have been archived so that the research can be defended later if necessary or differences between independent confirmations resolved. The archive might be private, as with traditional laboratory notebooks.
- _Open or Reproducible Research_. Auditable research made openly available. This comprised well-documented and fully open code and data that are publicly available that would allow one to (a) fully audit the computational procedure, (b) replicate and also independently reproduce the results of the research, and (c) extend the results or apply the method to new problems.

### The Turing Way definition of reproducibility

The Turing Way project will define reproducible research as both data and code being available to fully rerun the analysis.
![Kirstie's definition of reproducible research](https://github.com/pherterich/the-turing-way/blob/master/reproducibility_kirstie.png)
However, we recognize that some research will use sensitive data that cannot be shared and this handbook will provide guides on how your research can be reproducible without all parts necessarily being open.

## Checklist/Exercise
- [ ] define reproducibility for yourself

## What to learn next?
Open Science will be a good chapter to read next.
If you want to start learning hands-on practices, we recommend learning about version control next.
